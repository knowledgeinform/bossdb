                    or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively
                    by a state or federal court located in Baltimore, Maryland,

                    permitted (a) to bring small claims actions in state court
                    in the county in which you reside if such court has a small
                    claims procedure and if such court is located in the United
                    States of America; (b) to bring claims for injunctive relief
                    in any court having jurisdiction over the parties; or (c) to
                    seek enforcement of a judgment in any court having
